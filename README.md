                    Game information:
 Connect Four (also known as Captain's Mistress, Four Up,
 Plot Four, Find Four, Fourplay, Four in a Row, Four in a
 Line and Gravitrips (in Soviet Union) ) is a two-player
 connection game in which the players first choose a color
 and then take turns dropping colored discs from the top into
 a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid.
 The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available
 space within the column. The objective of the game is to be
 the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line
 of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game.
 The first player can always win by playing the right moves.

 The game was first sold under the famous Connect Four trademark
 by Milton Bradley in February 1974.
